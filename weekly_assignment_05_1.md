# Weekly Assignment 5.1

This assignment is worth 2.5 points. 

You will start to work with data for the "Process Blog" project (the data source for [Final Assignment 2](https://github.com/visualizedata/data-structures/blob/master/final_assignment_2.md)). 

## Assignment

### Part One: Plan

Using the Hills text as a starting point (but feel free to strike out on your own), draw a data model for your "Process Blog" data to be stored in this database table. Include all the content/data/variables from your "Process Blog" project that you believe to be relevant. Upload an image (`png` format) of your drawing to your GitHub repository.  

Some decisions that will help with this drawing:  
1. Will you use a [Normalized Data Model or a Denormalized Data Model](https://www.quora.com/What-is-normalized-vs-denormalized-data)? Why?  
2. When the data comes back out of the database, how should it be structured? Why?  
3. How would you describe the hierarchy of the data?  

### Part Two: Create some data and test its fit in Word

Using Word, populate three dummy NoSQL database entries that represent various plausible Process Blog entries (it's ok to use Lorem Ipsum for the text). 

### Submission requirements

Update your GitHub repository with the relevant files; **for this week, this should include the image/PDF of your (non)schema design and also your three Word files**. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository.
