# Weekly Assignment 4.1

This assignment is worth 2.5 points. 

You're going to continue working with the data you scraped, parsed, and augmented in the previous three assignments. In this assignment, you will write your AA data to a relational database. 

If you are new to SQL, consider [this tutorial](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/sql-essential-training-2).

## Assignment

Using the Hills text as a starting point (but feel free to strike out on your own), draw a data model for the AA meetings data to be stored in a database. Include all the content/data/variables from the source file that you believe to be relevant, even if you haven't parsed it yet. Upload an image (`png` format) of your drawing to your GitHub repository.  

Some decisions that will help with this drawing:  
1. Will you use a [Normalized Data Model or a Denormalized Data Model](https://www.quora.com/What-is-normalized-vs-denormalized-data)? Why?  
2. When the data comes back out of the database, how should it be structured? Why?  
3. How would you describe the hierarchy of the data?  

Using Excel, populate a dummy table(s) with ***ALL*** the data from the first three rows of the AA zone you have been working with. If you decide to organize this into multiple tables, create multiple tabs in the spreadsheet and make it clear how the tables would relate to each other. 

### Submission requirements

Update your GitHub repository with the relevant files; **for this week, this should include the image/PDF of your schema design and also your Excel file**. In Canvas, submit the URL of the specific location of this work within your `data-structures` GitHub repository.
